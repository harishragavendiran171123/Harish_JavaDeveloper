    <h1>Python is using in Back-end</h1>
    <pre>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]</pre>
